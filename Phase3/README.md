RISC-V Processor Simulator
Overview
This project implements a functional simulator for a subset of RISC-V architecture, developed in three phases. The current implementation covers:

Phase II: Non-Pipelined Execution
Basic single-cycle processor implementation

Five classic RISC stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, Write Back

Phase III: Pipelined Execution
5-stage pipeline implementation with hazard handling

Data forwarding and stalling mechanisms

Branch prediction with 1-bit predictor

Pipeline register tracing capabilities

Installation & Usage
Compilation
   # Non-pipelined version
g++ main.cpp alu_unit.cpp control_unit.cpp dec2bin.cpp global_variables.cpp immediate.cpp memory_read_write_funcs.cpp myRISCVSim.cpp registerfile.cpp -o output.exe

# Pipelined version (includes forwarding and branch prediction)
g++ main.cpp alu_unit.cpp BTB_operations.cpp control_unit.cpp forwarding_unit.cpp dec2bin.cpp global_variables.cpp immediate.cpp memory_read_write_funcs.cpp myRISCVSim.cpp registerfile.cpp -o output.exe

Execution: 
./output.exe <program_file.mc>

Example: ./output ../test/bubble_sort.mc
